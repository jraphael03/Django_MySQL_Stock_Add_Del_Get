information on the steps to format top of add_stock.html page

<!-- When a stock is added in the database it will show up here (from views.py) -->
<!-- {{ ticker }}<br/> -->    <!-- Prints out the data from the database (pulled from views.py) -->

<!--    Loop through the items in the database pulled from views.py
{% if ticker %}
    {% for item in ticker %}
{% endif %}
-->

<!--    USED TO PULL ITEMS FROM OUR DATABASE AND SHOW THEM ON THE PAGE, You can see how this was used for the table below
{% for item in ticker %}
    {{ item }} | <a href="{% url 'delete' item.id %}">Delete Stock</a></br>  <!- - Pass in the url to the delete path and id - ->      <!- - {{ item.id }}  to see the id of the items we are passing in from the db - ->
{% endfor %}

python3 -m venv (name virtual environment)

(Activate virtual env)
source venv/bin/activate

(If you want to exit the virtualenv)
Deactivate

(go back inside of the virtualenv)
(install django)
pip3 install django

(check to see if anything was installed using)
pip freeze

Django-admin.py startproject (project name)

(check to see if the file was created)
ls 

cd into directory
cd stocks

(run project)
python3 manage.py runserver

(Check to see that the server is running django runs on port 8000 in web browser)
http://localhost:8000/

install MySQL connector
pip install mysqlclient
python -m pip install mysql-connector-python

Go into settings and change the db you are using

(Migrate the db into python file)
python3 manage.py migrate


(if you are using mysqlite instead of mysqldb)
python manage.py createsuperuser
username      (name)
email address (email)
password       (password)

(Starting an app)
python3 manage.py startapp (app name)

After creating an app you need to add it to the settings.py file under installed apps
'quotes',

(every app that is created needs to have a urls.py file 
if you do not have one create a new file under the name urls.py)

in stocks urls.py file add include to the end of
from django.urls import path, include 

Now write a path to include the path needed to the app folder, this will allow us to start writing path in our app
path('', include('quotes.urls')),

Create a templates folder to hold our web pages
inside create a home.html file

After inside of stocks still create a view inside of views.py
def home(request):
    return render(request, 'home.html', {})     #create a function request the page/file we want to render then pass in a dictionary

Now we have to create the url for our page
from django.urls import path
from . import views;        # the period stand for this directory

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name="home" ),      #we are leaving the url space blank for the homepage but if you want you could write specific a url name
]




Base file is for base page designs that can be shared across all pages  Ex: items Navbar and Footer

To work with database we use the models.py file

After creating your Model or changing Model you want to use the command make migrations
python3 manage.py makemigrations

now push migration into the db
python3 manage.py migrate
